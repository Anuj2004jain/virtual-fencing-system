Intruder Detection System that uses the YOLOv8 Object Detection Model to identify whether the virtual fence - a perimeter defined by the homeowner has been breached or not.

The system captures the scene from the surveillance camera and the frame is put through YOLOv8

The detected humans are then put through the novel virtual fence logic to check whether they have breached the fence, in case intruders are detected, an alert is generated.
